## Project Overview

1. Customers (Groups): Arriving alone or in groups of 2 or 3, they must order and receive pizza before seating.
2. Tables: A fixed number of 1, 2, 3, and 4-person tables (X1, X2, X3, X4 tables respectively).
3. Seating Rules:
   - Customers cannot wait with hot pizza for seating.
   - Different groups cannot sit at the same table unless they are of equal size.
4. Fire Alarm: A firefighter sends a signal to simulate a fire, prompting immediate evacuation and closure of the cash register.
5. Cashier (Manager): Oversees operations, ensures profitability, and handles the closing procedures after a fire alarm.
